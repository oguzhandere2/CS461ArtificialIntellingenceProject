# CS461ArtificialIntellingenceProject
A school project which tries to guess NY Times Puzzle answers (See: https://www.nytimes.com/), using Python libraries.

WARNING: This is just a school project which uses a very inefficient heuristic.
The UI creation of the application will fail if NY Times decides to change the link/html hierarchy of the puzzle or any online libraries are disabled.
